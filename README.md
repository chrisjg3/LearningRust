# LearningRust
<strong> Read Description.  This is code I am copying and rewriting for practice, not my own original code.

This is a informal repository I am using to learn Rust, the files are just simple lines with explanations.  Real Rust project practice will come later.  I plan to recreate some of my early classwork projects or maybe try to create a project that is a hybrid of C++ and Rust.
